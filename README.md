# Mission to Mars Project
## Purpose of the Repository
The objective of this project is to provide user an interface to scrape data from different websites (e.g., redplanetscience.com etc) and essentially allows user to pull information about Mars. Every time user clicks the ‘Scrape’ button, the latest information will be showed up in the new website along with featured Mars images.
